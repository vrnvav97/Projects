This Project is built using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS. The purpose of this Project is to gain experience and hands on front end technologies and to gain knowledge about how things works.While working on this project I got to know about how JS works in client side mode, though it is a small project but an exciting game towards giving a kickstart to development process.The flow of this game goes like at initial level you have to guess any number between 1 to 10. For each guess which the user makes the system will give feedback basis on the difference or the similarity of the number guessed by user and the random number generated by system. After each correct guess the level of the game goes on increasing by five making it more difficult for user to guess the number.So go ahead and happy guessing !
